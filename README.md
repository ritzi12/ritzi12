## üî≠ Featured Projects

- [Real-time Tweet Sentiment Analysis and Wordclouds Dashboard](https://github.com/ritzi12/live-tweet-sentiment-app): This is a repository of a real time tweet sentiment analysis app built using streamlit platform and using Hugging Face Bertweet Model as core classifier model.
- [Bankruptcy Prediction in Highly Imbalanced Dataset Using Instance Hardness Threshold (IHT) Undersampling](https://github.com/ritzi12/bankruptcy_iht): Bankruptcy Prediction - By integrating Instance Hardness(IHT) based Under sampling and Supervised Learning Methods in highly Imbalanced dataset and SHAP Interpretation of Model
- [Hierarchical Risk PArity Based Portfolio Optimization Comparison](https://github.com/ritzi12/proj-portfolio-hrp): In this project we explore the method of HRP for porfolio composition which has well diversified risk. And we compare it's performance against conventional portfolio optimisation technique such as Markowitz Mean-Variance(MVP) Portfolio.
- [Probabilistic Neural Network(PNN) for Classification](https://github.com/ritzi12/pnn_probab_neural_net): In this notebook understanding PNN and its related concepts . Concepts of Parzen Window or KDE(kernel density estimate) .Kernel functions as non-parametric method to ascertain data distribution through an example. Implementation of PNN using python for classification tasks.

## üå± What I'm Currently Learning

I believe in continuous learning to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving field of data science. Currently, I'm focusing on:

- **Advanced NLP Techniques:** Exploring advanced NLP algorithms and models to enhance the capabilities of chatbot systems like LLMs and Generative AI Chat GPT.
- **Deep Learning for Finance:** Delving into deep learning techniques tailored for finance applications, such as time series analysis and neural networks.
- **Meta-Heuristics Techniques:** Exploring and reading learning on meta heuristic techniques such as Ant Colony Optimisation, Particle Swarm Optimisation , Tabu Search etc. 
- **Cloud Computing:** Expanding my knowledge of cloud platforms and services to leverage scalable and cost-effective solutions for data science projects.

## üëØ Looking to Collaborate?

I'm always open to collaborating on exciting data science projects that align with my interests. If you're working on a project at the intersection of finance, NLP, and data analytics, I would love to discuss how we can work together.
